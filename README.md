# Gardash Bey's Personal Web Demo

This project is a demonstration of advanced HTML5 content structuring and form creation, personalized for Gardash Bey. It showcases the use of semantic HTML5 elements, lists, tables, embedded media, and a fully-featured, accessible contact form—all without CSS or JavaScript.

## Features

- **Semantic Structure:** Uses `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` for clear, accessible layout.
- **Lists:** Includes ordered, unordered, and description lists with personalized content.
- **Table:** Displays a table of upcoming tech meetups with custom data.
- **Media:** Embeds a local image, audio, and video with captions relevant to Gardash Bey.
- **Contact Form:**
  - Uses `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, and `<label>` for accessibility.
  - Includes various input types: text, email, date, tel, select, checkbox, radio, and textarea.
  - Implements HTML5 validation attributes (`required`, `minlength`, `maxlength`, `pattern`, `readonly`, `autocomplete`, `placeholder`).
  - No JavaScript is used; all validation is native to HTML5.

## How to Use

1. Open `enhanced-form.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Explore the lists, table, and media sections.
3. Fill out and submit the contact form to see HTML5 validation in action.

## Personalization

- All content (lists, table, media, and form) is tailored to Gardash Bey.
- Media files (`camara.jpg`, `6.2c.mp3`, `Ultimate.mp4`) should be present in the same directory for full functionality.
- You can further personalize the content by editing the HTML file.

## File Structure

- `enhanced-form.html` — Main HTML5 file with all content and form.
- `camara.jpg` — Image used in the media section.
- `6.2c.mp3` — Audio file used in the media section.
- `Ultimate.mp4` — Video file used in the media section.
